                            currentAverageUtilization is the current value of the average of the
                            resource metric across all relevant pods, represented as a percentage of
                            the requested value of the resource for the pods.  It will only be
                            present if `targetAverageValue` was set in the corresponding metric
                            specification.

                            a percentage of the request), similar to the "pods" metric source type.
                            It will always be set, regardless of the corresponding metric specification.
